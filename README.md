DAY-26 TASK 


The objective of this task is to create a web page with routes using react-router-dom.

When clicking on the links, a router in your web application can be configured to display corresponding component. Each link corresponds to a specific route, and upon clicking, the associated Data component is rendered. For example, in a React application using react-router-dom, you can define routes for each link and create components with the desired content. Links, such as 'Link 1' and 'Link 2', can be used to navigate to specific routes, triggering the display of relevant content. This approach provides a structured way to organize and present information based on user interactions
